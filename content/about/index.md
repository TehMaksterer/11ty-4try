        I <strong>love</strong> videogames! My first system with the Super Nintendo. I was very excited when my dad brought it home one evening. It was like an alien machine that made colourful and interactive graphics on the TV. It was something magical. 
        <br>
        My top 5 videogames are:
        <ol>
          <li> Persona 5: Royal (PS4)</li>
          <li> World of Warcraft (PC) </li>
          <li> Halo: Combat Evolved (PC)</li>
          <li> Red Dead Redemption 2 (PS4) </li>
          <li> Super Smash Bros. Melee (GC) </li>

        I find that I don't have time to sit down to watch movies or TV shows at home unless I am eating. However I really do enjoy the cinema experience. I have fond memories going to the cinema with my parents or birthday parties and escaping into a story for a couple of hours.

        I don't think so. At least, not in the sci-fi dystopian sense but I think we will learn to live with A.I. just as we have learnt to live with all emerging technologies such as mobile phones, contactless payments, or even further back with credit cards, emails, and even the car! A.I. will supercede certain aspects of our life to make things easier but I think like with the above- it will also be a bit of trial and error before we reach a nice middle ground.
