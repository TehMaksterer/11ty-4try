<p> I was inspired to start coding thanks to two men: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carmack" target="_blank"> John Carmack </a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Romero" target="_blank"> John Romero</a>.
They are heroes in my eyes and their story in creating revolutionary games such as Doom, Quake, and pioneering the 'shareware' model of distribution is inspirational.
Below is a picture of the two next to a Ferrari Testarossa using their earnings from making games </p>
